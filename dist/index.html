            We acknowledge the island of Ktaqmkuk as the ancestral homeland and
            territory of the Beothuk and the Mi’kmaq and Labrador as the
            ancestral territory of the Innu of Nitassinan, Inuit of Nunatsiavut,
            and Inuit of NunatuKavut. We hold deep respect for the cultures,
            traditions and knowledge of all those who call these places home. We
            acknowledge the damage of the past and the persistence of racist
            attitudes and policies. We will work with Indigenous partners to
            make these territories places of healing and shared knowledge.

            <h4 class="faq__question">Whose idea was Food Producers Forum?</h4>
            <p class="faq__answer">
              The need for a provincial information hub was identified by
              twenty-one stakeholders who met at the MUN Botanical Garden in
              2019 as part of the consultation that helped create the Earth
              Sheltered Greenhouse. Each group had its own job to do and its own
              political allegiances, making it impossible for any of them to
              fill that role. So we founded Food Producers Forum, with funding
              support from Memorial University’s Office of Public Engagement.

            <h4 class="faq__question">What does Food Producers Forum do?</h4>
            <p class="faq__answer">
              We are creating an information hub to allow gardeners, growers,
              farmers, hunters, fishers and foragers to directly exchange
              information, to expand access to healthy, local food and help
              return our province to the level of food security we previously
              enjoyed, when most communities had gardens and livestock for local
              food production. We believe that with so many thousands of us
              returning to home food production, we already have the capacity to
              rapidly expand food security. With networks of local food
              distribution solidifying, we want to help with this important
              challenge.

              I have a question about gardening. Can I ask it here?
            </h4>
            <p class="faq__answer">
              There are two Facebook pages (​Backyard Farming and Homesteading
              and Backyard Vegetable Farmers NL) where you can ask questions and
              share information with other gardeners. On those pages you will
              find a wide variety of answers, some informed and accurate, some
              not so much. Our website is becoming an “online encyclopedia” of
              articles and links to those with experience and knowledge in
              different areas of food production. You will find these people on
              the blog sites linked through the green band on our main page. You
              can also email us with your questions and we will find someone to
              answer them.

            <p class="faq__answer">
              Absolutely! We welcome volunteers. We are looking for individuals
              to help with posting on social media, building our new earth
              sheltered greenhouse, writing articles, helping us plan a major
              conference for the Fall and in general, spreading the word around
              the province that we exist as a hub for food production.
