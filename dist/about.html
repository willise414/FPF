        <h2>We are an Information Hub for Local Food Products</h2>
        <p>
          We are a public information hub promoting information and services to
          help food producers at all levels in the province of Newfoundland and
          Labrador move toward food security by producing more of what we eat
          and use right here at home.
        </p>

        <p>
          Food Producers Forum, Inc. is a provincially registered non-profit
          society created as part of the Earth Sheltered Greenhouse Project in
          2019. The need for an information hub was identified by 21 local
          stakeholders during consultation meetings at the MUN Botanical Garden
          that year.
        </p>
        <p>
          We welcome new partners to help us focus on key issues, challenges and
          opportunities to help build a better food system in our province. Send
          us your questions and suggestions.

            Dan is a retired educator with a Master’s Degree in Curriculum
            Design from the University of Victoria. During his thirty-year
            career in education, he served as a teacher at the elementary,
            secondary and university levels, as a school principal in two
            provinces and worked as a developer of unique learner centered
            educational programs. This work earned an award from the Prime
            Minister of Canada in 2000. For two periods he led teams to create
            programs for the renewal of traditional indigenous languages, while
            collaborating with native elders. Since retiring from education and
            moving to Newfoundland in 2002, he has been active as a musical
            performer, arts administrator, writer and publisher.
            <br />
            <br />
            In the past he has led a series of community development,
            educational and arts groups. Here in Newfoundland he has served as a
            board member of the Writers’ Alliance, president of the Newfoundland
            and Labrador Musicians Association and founded and chaired the Pouch
            Cove Heritage Society. The book which he edited and designed, Pouch
            Cove: Our Home by the Sea, received the Manning Heritage Award in
            2015.
            <br />
            <br />
            As a home gardener he has built on his undergraduate degree in
            biology (Reed College, 1968) to develop new approaches to local food
            production. His workshops on Creating the Year Round Garden have
            been attended by more than 800 people, and he now is contributing to
            food security as facilitator of the Earth Sheltered Greenhouse
            Project and Chair of the Food Producers Forum. He has written
            articles for regional magazines and produced a ten episode radio
            series about gardening for CHMR Radio called “Uncle Dirt.” He is
            currently writing a northern gardening book to be published by
            Boulder in 2022.

          <p class="about" id="about">
            Jeremy grew up in St. John’s and spent summers at his family’s Mt.
            Scio Farm. He enjoyed biking and being outdoors as much as possible.
            He attended high school then studied science at Memorial University
            and agriculture at McGill. These days he is involved in running the
            family farm, growing summer savory and is responsible for drying and
            packaging this beloved local herb.
            <br />
            <br />
            He was involved in a successful challenge to a group of American
            mobsters who wanted to import and burn US garbage here. Now he
            realizes that by doing this he saved his own children from the
            impacts of this highly polluting activity, creating a better place
            for them to live. Jeremy has spent time in Costa Rica where he has
            travelled more than once, marveling at seeing people living closer
            to the soil, surrounded by so much biodiversity.
            <br />
            <br />
            Jeremy brings to the Food Producers Forum decades of hands-on
            experience in agriculture. On a practical level, as a person
            directly involved in agriculture, Jeremy sees this work as wealth
            creation, and a way to use our resources more efficiently. He
            understands the medium and larger scale potential for food
            production here. At that scale, what is really needed are more
            opportunities for incubation of new ideas and exchange of
            information to help everyone food move forward to become more
            diversified and more productive.
            <br /><br />
            He believes that the Food Producers Forum is a critical missing
            piece that can make a huge difference to agriculture and local food
            security. Rather than exchanging abstract or academic information,
            we can share practical tips and exchange better methods for growing,
            storing and distributing food. There are ways we can move ahead
            through small-scale inventiveness applied to the devices we use.
            Small improvements can generate real efficiencies and success.

            Alison grew up in Mount Pearl in a family of seven and spent a lot
            of time with friends, volunteering and babysitting. She graduated
            from Mt. Pearl Central High (now Mt. Pearl Senior High) in 1986. She
            spent several years working at various jobs while attending Memorial
            University. She then attended Cabot College (now College of the
            North Atlantic) and graduated from the Computer Studies (Co-op)
            program in 1998.
            <br />
            <br />
            She started her career in IT at what is now Bell (fomerly xwave) and
            now works at Memorial University in the IT department as a Systems
            Analyst. Her main responsibilities include support for the
            Registration and Grading function at MUN and the Marine Institute
            <br />
            <br />
            As part of the Memorial Community Garden Board, Alison helped plan
            and implement a garden expansion in which the number of available
            plots doubled from 30 to 60 and building a greenhouse for garden
            members. She was a member of the Memorial Campus Food Bank and
            worked to connect the Food Bank with the MUN Community Garden, to
            encourage donations of surplus crops to the Food Bank.
            <br /><br />
            She has always lived in Newfoundland, with the exception of two
            four-month work terms in Ottawa during her Computer Studies. Alison
            has travelled to various parts of Europe, the US, Dominican
            Republic, Cuba and about half of Canada and hopes to visit Europe
            and other parts of the world with her children.

            Heather grew up in Port Moody, BC, a community at the end of the
            Barnet Inlet, down the hill from Simon Fraser University (SFU). She
            went to school at SFU and earned a graduate degree in psychology.
            She spent several years working as an academic advisor and moved
            into information technology while working on a project for the
            university. On moving to St. John’s, NL, she began working with
            other universities to help them implement new student administration
            systems to manage their student records and processes from admission
            to graduation. As a consultant, she has traveled to work with
            institutions in cities across North America.
            <br />
            <br />
            She spent her childhood hiking on Burnaby Mountain and the mountains
            of the Lower Mainland and she learned about plants and gardening
            from her parents and friends, growing flowers, shrubs, and trees in
            Port Moody and in Burnaby. For many years, she volunteered with the
            SFU Student Bursary Plant Sale Committee to raise funds for students
            in need through the sale of plants raised by plant sale committee
            members and donors. After moving to St. John’s, NL, she started
            raising flowers and vegetables from seed, creating compost, and
            building beds. Relocating to Holyrood, she began producing food on a
            larger scale, experimenting with greenhouses and raised, no-dig
            beds.
            <br />
            <br />
            Through research on growing in cold climates and food security, she
            found the Greenhouse Outreach Project and volunteered to help build
            the demonstration greenhouse at O’Brien’s Farm and interview project
            participants about their plans for their own greenhouse. She joined
            the Food Producer Forum (FPF) Board to learn more about and to help
            with food production projects. To the Board she brings her interest
            in local food production, food sustainability, and food security, in
            addition to skills in business analysis, project management,
            research, and writing.

            Samantha grew up in St. John’s but now lives in Western
            Newfoundland, where she leads sustainability projects for the city
            of Corner Brook. Her presence there will allow her to connect Food
            Producers Forum with the municipal level, for future policies to
            support healthy local food.
            <br /><br />
            Samantha holds a BA in Environmental Studies from Memorial
            University and is in the final months of completing her Master’s in
            Environmental Policy with a focus on Food Security and Community
            Food Programs. Her research has focused on food systems and food
            sovereignty on the Great Northern Peninsula, compared with similar
            systems in Iceland.
            <br /><br />
            Ms. Young has assisted us as a researcher, team member and
            coordinator of speakers for our May 2022 provincial conference. All
            this while working as an academic research assistant, managing a
            forest school for children in the summers, and supporting other
            community-oriented non-profit groups. She is currently employed by
            the City of Corner Brook as their Sustainability Coordinator.

          <h3 class="status" id="status">Board Member</h3>
          <p class="about" id="about">
            Atanu is originally from India, where he studied medicine and public
            health. He completed environmental studies at Queen’s University
            before joining Memorial University as a faculty member. He has
            served with the United Nations for various health projects.
            <br /><br />
            Atanu holds a MBBS degree in Medicine (Burdwan University, India
            1992); PhD in Public Health (Jawaharlal University, 2005); Master’s
            Degree in Environmental Studies (Queens University Kingston 2010).
            He has published extensively in a series of studies about the
            impacts of environmental contaminants on human health. Currently he
            teaches public health for undergraduate medical students and
            graduate students in public health.
            <br /><br />
            Atanu Sarkar has been involved in food security related activities
            for decades, working in India, Ethiopia and in Newfoundland. He has
            worked with various community-based organizations and individuals,
            such as greenhouse projects for more than five years, in various
            capacities. He edited a volume on climate change, food security and
            adaptation with contributions by researchers from 18 different
            countries.
            <br /><br />
            He recently led a project to study food insecurity among the single
            parents and seniors in St John’s, a project was funded by Harris
            Centre at MUN. The article about that research was just published.
            He has also supervised a graduate student exploring the food culture
            of Newfoundland and has published in Newfoundland Quarterly.
            <br /><br />
            With two grants from the Canadian Institute of Health Research
            (CIHR), Atanu has worked on promoting community based food
            production in the Mi’kmaq community at Conne River. A second project
            there is still ongoing. Currently, he is faculty sponsor for the
            project funded by the MUN Office of Public Engagement that is
            building the Earth Sheltered Greenhouse for public demonstration of
            year round food production at the O’Brien Farm in St. John’s.

          <h3 class="status" id="status">Board Member</h3>
          <p class="about" id="about">
            Solange grew up in a small village called Baba 1, Ndop in the North
            West Region of Cameroon. On their farm her family grew just about
            everything they ate: beans, potatoes, tomatoes, corn, peanuts, rice,
            fruit.
            <br /><br />
            In her earlier years she was a volunteer for her aunt’s non-profit
            organization called Nascent Solutions Inc.. Solange was educated at
            St. Augustine’s College, Nso, and graduated in 2002 with a GCE
            A-Level Certificate. Then she went on to the University of Buea, but
            due to unforeseen circumstances, had to drop out of school, and was
            not able to return until now.
            <br /><br />
            She lived and worked in Accra, Ghana for about a month in 2018 and
            hopes to travel as soon as she can and if possible, work overseas.
            Solange brings years of farming experience (what most people will
            refer to as kitchen gardening) to our work, as well as the zeal to
            find a way to produce food locally and organically.
            <br /><br />
            She currently lives in St. John’s where she is an undergraduate
            engineering student at MUN. She is hoping during her university
            career to work on very interesting things.
            <br /><br />
            Solange is also a single mother of a rambunctious toddler and she
            worries about what he puts in his stomach – where it is coming from,
            how it was produced, how it is preserved, and if it is generally
            safe. She brings this practical, personal perspective to all our
            discussions of food production and food security.

          <h2 class="name" id="name">Rachel Snelgrove</h2>
          <h3 class="status" id="status">Board Member</h3>
          <p class="about" id="about">
            Rachel Snelgrove is an Indigenous student at Memorial University who
            is pursuing a Bachelor of Biology degree, with a concentration in
            Applied Ecology and Conservation. Her experience in the Greenhouse
            Production Program at Academy Canada inspired her to continue her
            studies at Memorial, with a focus on food security.
            <br /><br />
            Raised in Labrador, Rachel is passionate about Northern food
            security and sustainability. She understands the challenges of
            climate and the costs of importing food for people who live in the
            North. She wants to make sure that everyone can enjoy the benefits
            of eating healthy food. Her perspective is both cultural and
            ecological, a symbiosis that brings together ecological
            understanding and traditional knowledge.
            <br /><br />
            Rachel regularly canoes the Churchill River where she finds
            inspiration from the traditional trapper’s way of life. She traveled
            to Tanzania, Africa, as a student volunteer where she had the
            opportunity to climb to the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro. While in
            Africa, she saw how food sustainability has impacted tribal
            communities, in a place where children walk to school kilometers
            away not just to be educated, but to be fed. This experience planted
            a seed of deep commitment for her future studies and chosen career
            path. In her spare time, she enjoys exploring the Province’s
            wilderness with her dogs.
            <br /><br />
            Rachel brings to our board practical knowledge of plant growth and
            greenhouse production methods from working at Lester’s Farm Market
            in St. John’s. She is currently a farm associate at the Pye Centre
            for Northern Boreal Food Systems, operated as part of the Labrador
            Campus of Memorial University. Her role there includes organizing
            community events and management of the farm. As a member of the
            board of Food Producers Forum, Rachel will provide a voice for
            Indigenous and Northern communities in our province.
